    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>FEES AND PURCHASE TERMS.
    <ul>
      <li>Third-Party Service Provider. WTR uses Stripe, Inc. and its affiliates as its third-party service provider for payment services (e.g., card acceptance, merchant settlement, and related services) (“Third-Party Service Provider”). If you make a purchase on the Service, you will be required to provide your payment details and any additional information required to complete your order directly to our Third-Party Service Provider. You agree to be bound by Stripe’s Privacy Policy (currently accessible at <a href="https://stripe.com/us/privacy" target="_blank">https://stripe.com/us/privacy</a>) and its Terms of Service (currently accessible at <a href="https://stripe.com/ssa" target="_blank">https://stripe.com/ssa</a>) and hereby consent and authorize the WTR and Stripe to share any information and payment instructions you provide with one or more Third-Party Service Provider(s) to the minimum extent required to complete your transactions. Please note that online payment transactions may be subject to validation checks by our Third-Party Service Provider and your card issuer, and we are not responsible if your card issuer declines to authorize payment for any reason. For your protection, our Third-Party Service Provider uses various fraud prevention protocols and industry standard verification systems to reduce fraud and you authorize it to verify and authenticate your payment information. Your card issuer may charge you an online handling fee or processing fee. We are not responsible for this. In some jurisdictions, our Third-Party Service Provider may use third parties under strict confidentiality and data protection requirements for the purposes of payment processing services.</li>
      <li>Payment. You shall pay all fees or charges (“Fees”) to your Account in accordance with the fees, charges and billing terms in effect at the time a Fee is due and payable. By providing WTR and/or our Third-Party Service Provider with your payment information, you agree that WTR and/or our Third-Party Service Provider is authorized to immediately invoice your Account for all Fees due and payable to WTR hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is required. WTR reserves the right at any time to change its prices and billing methods in its sole discretion. You agree to have sufficient funds or credit available upon placement of any order to ensure that the purchase price is collectible by us. Your failure to provide accurate payment information to WTR and/or our Third-Party Service Provider or our inability to collect payment constitutes your material breach of this Agreement. Except as set forth in this Agreement, all Fees for the Service are non-refundable.</li>
      <li>Subscriptions. If you purchase access to certain features and functionality of the Services on a time-limited basis (a “Subscription”), the Fee for such Subscription (“Service Subscription Fee”) will be billed at the start of the Subscription (“Subscription Service Commencement Date”). WTR reserves the right to change the timing of our billing. WTR reserves the right to change the Subscription pricing at any time in accordance with Section 17.6 (Agreement Updates). If changes to the Subscription price occur that impact your Subscription, WTR will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you, such as by sending an email to the email address associated with your Account.</li>
      <li>Taxes. The Fees do not include any Sales Tax (defined below) that may be due in connection with the Service provided under this Agreement. If WTR determines it has a legal obligation to collect Sales Tax from you in connection with this Agreement, WTR shall collect such Sales Tax in addition to the Fees. If any services or payments under this Agreement are subject to any Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to WTR, you shall be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you shall indemnify WTR for any liability or expense WTR may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes. Upon WTR’s request, you will provide it with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this section, “Sales Tax” means any sales or use tax and any other tax measured by sales proceeds that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.</li>
      <li>Withholding Taxes. You shall make all payments of Fees to WTR free and clear of, and without reduction for, any withholding taxes. Any such taxes imposed on payments of Fees to WTR shall be your sole responsibility, and you shall provide WTR with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or such other evidence as we may reasonably request, to establish that such taxes have been paid.</li>
      <li>Advertising Revenue. WTR reserves the right to display Third-Party Ads before, after, or in conjunction with Content posted on the Service, and you acknowledge and agree that WTR has no obligation to you in connection therewith (including, without limitation, any obligation to share revenue received by WTR as a result of such advertising).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>INDEMNIFICATION. You shall indemnify and hold WTR, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, agents, partners, suppliers, and licensors (each, a “WTR Party” and collectively, the “WTR Parties”) harmless from any losses, costs, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) relating to or arising out of any and all of the following: (i) Your Content; (ii) your use of, or inability to use, the Service; (iii) your violation of this Agreement; (iv) your violation of any rights of another party, including any user; or (v) your violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations. WTR reserves the right, at its own cost, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with WTR in asserting any available defenses. This provision does not require you to indemnify any of the WTR Parties for any unconscionable commercial practice by such party or for such party’s fraud, deception, false promise, misrepresentation or concealment, or suppression or omission of any material fact in connection with the Service provided hereunder. You agree that the provisions in this section will survive any termination of your Account, this Agreement and/or your access to the Service.</li>

  </li>

  <li>PROCEDURE FOR MAKING CLAIMS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT INFRINGEMENT. It is WTR’s policy to terminate membership privileges of any user who repeatedly infringes copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights upon prompt notification to WTR by the respective intellectual property owner or their legal agent. Without limiting the foregoing, if you believe that your work has been copied and posted on the Service in a way that constitutes intellectual property rights infringement, please send an email to disagreeonline@gmail.com with the following information:
    <ul>
      <li>(i) an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right;</li>
      <li>(ii) a description of the copyrighted work, trademark, or other intellectual property right that you claim has been infringed;</li>

      <li>(iv) your address, telephone number, and email address;</li>
      <li>(v) a written statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right owner, its agent or the law; and</li>
      <li>(vi) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right owner or authorized to act on the copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right owner’s behalf.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>TERM AND TERMINATION.
    <ul>
      <li>Term. The term of this Agreement commences on the date when you accept this Agreement (as described in the preamble above), and continues in full force and effect while you use the Service, unless terminated earlier in accordance with this Agreement.</li>
      <li>Termination of Service by WTR. Except as set forth above, the Service Subscription Fee for any Service is non-refundable. If you have materially breached any provision of this Agreement, or if WTR is required to do so by law (e.g., where the provision of the Service is, or becomes, unlawful), WTR has the right to, immediately and without notice, suspend or terminate any Service provided to you. WTR reserves the right to terminate this Agreement or your access to the Service at any time without cause upon notice to you. You agree that all terminations for cause are made in WTR’s sole discretion and that WTR shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your Account.</li>
      <li>Termination by You. If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by (i) notifying WTR at any time and (ii) closing your Account for the Service. Your notice should be sent, in writing, to WTR’s email address set forth below.</li>
      <li>Effect of Termination. Upon termination of the Service or the applicable feature or functionality thereof, your right to use the Service or the applicable feature or functionality thereof will automatically terminate, and we may delete Your Content associated therewith from our live databases. If we terminate your Account for cause, we may also bar your further use or access to the Service. WTR will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any suspension or termination, including for deletion of Your Content. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive, will survive termination of Service, including without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.</li>
      <li>No Subsequent Registration. If this Agreement is terminated for cause by WTR or if your Account or ability to access the Service is discontinued by WTR due to your violation of any portion of this Agreement or for conduct otherwise deemed inappropriate, then you agree that you shall not attempt to re-register with or access the Service through use of a different email address or otherwise.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>INTERNATIONAL USERS. The Service may be accessed from countries around the world and may contain references to services and Content that are not available in your country. These references do not imply that WTR intends to announce such service or Content in your country. The Service is controlled and offered by WTR from its facilities in the United States of America. WTR makes no representations that the Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Service from other countries do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.</li>

  <li>ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. Please read this section (the “Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It is part of your contract with WTR and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
    <ul>
      <li>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and WTR agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement and prior versions of this Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between you and us before the effective date of this Agreement (each, a “Dispute”) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that:
        <ul>
          <li>(i) you and WTR may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and</li>
          <li>(ii) you or WTR may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Informal Dispute Resolution. There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and WTR. If that occurs, WTR is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. You and WTR agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome (“Informal Dispute Resolution”). You and WTR therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<p>The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Notice to WTR that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to disagreeonline@gmail.com. The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your Account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.
</p>
<p>The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND WTR HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and WTR are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 16.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement). There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</li>

  <li>Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief. YOU AND WTR AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 16.9 (BATCH ARBITRATION), EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 16.9 (Batch Arbitration). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and WTR agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of New York. All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. This section does not prevent you or WTR from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.</li>

  <li>Rules and Forum. This Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. If the Informal Dispute Resolution process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and WTR agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are currently available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the “Request”). The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable Account; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.</p>
<p>If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. Such counsel must also sign the Request. By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.</p>
<p>Unless you and WTR otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 16.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.</p>
<p>You and WTR agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Arbitrator. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of New York and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under Section 16.9 (Batch Arbitration) is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.</li>

  <li>Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following:
    <ul>
      <li>(1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to Section 16.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief), including any claim that all or part of Section 16.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section 16.4 (Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator;</li>
      <li>(2) except as expressly contemplated in Section 16.9 (Batch Arbitration), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator;</li>
      <li>(3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and</li>
      <li>(4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.</li>
    </ul>
    The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in Section 16.9 (Batch Arbitration). The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
  </li>

  <li>Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If you or WTR need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration. The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.</li>

  <li>Batch Arbitration. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and WTR agree that in the event that there are one-hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against WTR by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall:
    <ul>
      <li>(1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests);</li>
      <li>(2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and</li>
      <li>(3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“Administrative Arbitrator”). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by WTR.</p>

<p>You and WTR agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.</p>

<p>This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.</p>



<ul>
  <li>30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to <a href="mailto:disagreeonline@gmail.com">disagreeonline@gmail.com</a> within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, the email address associated with your Account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</li>

  <li>Invalidity, Expiration. Except as provided in Section 16.4 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. You further agree that any Dispute that you have with WTR as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred. Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.</li>

  <li>Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if WTR makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, we will notify you. Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing to WTR at <a href="mailto:disagreeonline@gmail.com">disagreeonline@gmail.com</a>, your continued use of the Service, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Service following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration. If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Service or this Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement) remain in full force and effect. WTR will continue to honor any valid opt-outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of this Agreement.</li>
