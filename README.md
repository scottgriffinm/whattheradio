A radio station hosting platform built with Express.

Features a custom radio station builder, a discover page for all created stations, and free and paid tiers. Includes Stripe integration and AWS hosting and content delivery.

Radio stations are created by uploading a radio mix and choosing a YouTube video. The radio station "streams" live by downloading the radio mix, then starting the audio and YouTube video relative to time.
